## Debugging Slight but noticeable issue with simple simulations

I'm also going through this to make it as easy to use as possible. This includes making everything run as a script with easy to understand configuration files. 

A script should take in a csv containing all of the needed simulation information for a given run, organized by thread. These csvs can be created by a python script or notebook.
