# Getting a Representative Gas Mixture Isotherm using GCMC

The actual goal of this Thesis is to create isotherms of gas mixtures. This is the "result" so to speak now that the various problems were solved.


## Steps of Experiment: 
1. Determine the number of iterations needed to equilibrate at max pressure
    a. Determine the EQ length for pure CO2 at max pressure
    b. Determine the EQ length for pure Methane at max pressure
    c. Determine the EQ lenght for yco = 0.5
2. For yco 0.2 thru 0.8
    a. For a range of pressures
        i. Run 5 simulations to completion
3. Return these results as readable Isotherms with confidence intervals
